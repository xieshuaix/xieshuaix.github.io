# Hi!
Welcome to my personal site!
<br/>
I graduated from Oxford University, UK with Bachelor and Master of Engineering. I love cooking and coding. I also have an affection for puffy and fluffy animals including cats, dogs, hamsters and owls.
I am interested in developing algorithms that actually work in real life application.

My academic interests include:
* Computer Vision (CNN, RNN, classification, etc.)
* Natural Language Processing (translation, abstraction, classification, etc.)
* Machine Learning (Bayesian inference, Markov Chain, clustering, decision tree, etc.)

Please feel free to view my highlighted projects on "Project" page.

This site is built using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub.
