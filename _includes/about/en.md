# Hi!
I graduated from Oxford University, UK with Bachelor and Master of Engineering. I love cooking and coding. I also have an affection for puffy and fluffy animals including cats, dogs, hamsters and owls.
I build algorithms that actually work in real life application.

My academic interests focus on:
* Computer Vision (CNN, RNN, classification, etc.)
* Natural Language Processing (translation, abstraction, classification, etc.)
* Machine Learning (Bayesian inference, Markov Chain, clustering, decision tree, etc.)
